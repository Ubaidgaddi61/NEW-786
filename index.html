<h2>Geography is the study of the Earth, its physical features, and the relationship between people and their environment. It explores the distribution of places, landscapes, climates, and populations across the globe. Geography helps us understand how natural processes shape the Earth and how human activities influence and are influenced by the world around them. By combining knowledge from both the natural and social sciences, geography provides valuable insights into global issues such as climate change, urban development, resource management, and cultural diversity..</h2>
